# Hypertension and Hbp

    - Medical term for high blood pressure.
    - Blood pressure refers to the pressure that blood applies to the inner walls of the arteries. 
    - Arteries carry blood from the heart to other organs and parts of the body.

    - Untreated high blood pressure increases the strain on the heart and arteries, eventually causing organ damage.  
    - High blood pressure increases the risk of heart failure, heart attack (myocardial infarction), stroke, and kidney failure.

# Medication
    
    - To lower blood pressure medication may be recommended if your blood pressure is consistently high, usually at or above 140/90.
    - Treatment with medicine is recommended at a lower blood pressure for some older people and for those with atherosclerosis (fatty deposits lining the arteries, as in coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral artery disease), diabetes, or chronic kidney disease complicated by protein in the urine.
