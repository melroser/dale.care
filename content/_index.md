# Asthma

Asthma is a chronic condition with symptoms that may include cough, wheezing, chest tightness
or pain, and/or difficulty breathing. These symptoms occur periodically, usually related 
to specific triggering events. The small airways of people with asthma narrow 
during these episodes; the narrowing is partially or completely reversible with asthma treatments.

# Rick Factors:

- Viral infections - Watch our for wheezing children!
- Pollution – Avoid polition use and air purifier!
- Tobacco Smoke – Avoid altogether including pregency!

# Overflow

Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and throughout childhood increases the risk of developing

Exposure to indoor and outdoor pollution may increase the risk of developing asthma. with respiratory syncytial virus or rhinovirus seem to be at increased risk for developing asthma.

Family history Children with a personal or family history of certain medical problems, such as asthma, allergies, or eczema, are at increased risk of developing asthma.
Stress severely negative life events in children increase the risk of asthma attacks over the subsequent few weeks.

# Exercise-Induced Asthma:

Narrowing of the airways can be triggered by exercise. This is called exercise-induced asthma (also called exercise-induced broncho-constriction or EIB). Breathlessness, wheeze, and/or cough usually occur within 10 minutes of the cool-down period after vigorous exercise but may occur during exercise. These symptoms tend to disappear after 20 to 45 minutes

Having EIA doesn't mean students should skip sports, gym classes, or other physical activities. As well as keeping them fit, exercise can strengthen the breathing muscles in the chest and help their lungs work better. But students with EIA may need to use inhalers before they exercise.
Teachers and coaches can help students with EIA by:
    * reminding them to carry and use their inhaler before activity
    * making time for proper warm-ups and cool-downs during practices, games, and other physical activities
    * encouraging them to breathe through the nose during exercise
    * having them take breaks during exercise and use an inhaler as prescribed if symptoms start
    * avoiding exercise in cold temperatures (or having students wear a ski mask or scarf over their mouth and nose if this can't be avoided)

# Self Managment

The essential components of effective asthma self-management include:
Self-monitoring of symptoms with or without peak flow
A written asthma action plan that guides patients to recognize and respond to worsening asthma
Regular review of asthma control, treatments, and skills by a health care provider

# Irritants and Triggers
    - House dust (ie, dust mites, cockroaches, mice droppings), particularly during vacuuming
    - Animal exposures; cats and dogs are especially provocative, but other furry animals (gerbils, rabbits, hamsters, etc) may be suspect, particularly if symptoms only occur in settings where these animals reside
    - Pollens (the pollen season and types of pollen vary depending upon the region and climate)
    - Molds
    - Indoor pollutants (eg, paint, perfume, cleaning products, space heaters, gas stoves, room deodorizers)
    - Smoke (tobacco from cigarettes or vaping, wood-burning stoves)

# Recommendations:
    - Maintain low humidity at home.: If you live in a damp climate, talk to your child's doctor about using a device to keep the air drier, called a dehumidifier.
    - Have a heating and air conditioning professional check your air conditioning system every year. Change the filters in your furnace and air conditioner according to the manufacturer's instructions. Also consider installing a small-particle filter in your ventilation system.
    - If your child is allergic to dander, it's best to avoid pets with fur or feathers. If you have pets, regularly bathing or grooming them also might reduce the amount of dander. Keep pets out of your child's room.
    - Reduce dust that can aggravate nighttime symptoms by adjusting certain items in your child's bedroom. For example, encase pillows, mattresses and box springs in dust-proof covers. 	Stay away from feather or down pillows or comforters. Wash bed sheets and pillow cases once a week in hot water (130 F). Put items that can't be washed in high heat (in the dryer at 130 F for 20 minutes) or extreme cold ( the freezer -1 to -4 F) overnight once per month. Drying or freezing can kill mites and remove the droppings, though washing things is still preferable.
    - Consider removing carpeting and installing hard flooring in your home, particularly in your child's bedroom. Use washable curtains and blinds. Do not use ceiling fans. Use an air cleaner/ air purifier with a HEPA filter in the bedroom and living room, or in the room where your child spends the most time. 
    - Clean your home at least once a week to remove dust and allergens.. Clean bathrooms, kitchens and basements by scrubbing with soap and water once a week. Avoid using bleach solution when the person with asthma is home. Bleach solution of one part bleach to nine parts water must be used in a well-ventilated area and not mixed with other chemicals.

# Self-montoring

The management of asthma relies on a patient's ability to monitor their asthma 
regularly. Self-monitoring includes assessing the frequency and severity of symptoms (such as wheezing and shortness of breath) and measurement of lung function with a peak flow meter.
Peak flow meters measure your peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), a number that correlates with how open the lung's airways are; as asthma worsens and the airways narrow, the PEFR decreases. Monitoring can help you and your healthcare provider determine the most appropriate asthma treatment plan.

# Infant safety:
    - Handling the baby – When picking up or holding your newborn, support their body, especially their head and neck. Be gentle, and never shake a baby. When you put your baby down, make sure that they are in a safe place such as a crib, cradle, or bassinet.
    - Sleep – Always put your baby on their back on a flat surface to sleep. They should sleep in a crib, cradle, or bassinet without any pillows, blankets, or other objects in it. The mattress should be firm, not soft. Having your baby sleep in your bed (bed-sharing) increases your baby’s chance of dying of Sudden Unexplained Infant Deaths (SUID).
    - Temperature – Dress your newborn in clothing that will keep them from getting too hot or too cold. If their hands or feet feel cold, cover them with mittens or socks.
    - Travel –  An approved car seat is the most important piece of equipment you can have for your baby's safety. Babies must ride in a properly fitted rear-facing car seat in the back seat until they’re at least 2-years-old or they reach the weight or height limit of their rear-facing seat.
    - Preventing the spread of germs – Anyone who holds or touches your newborn should wash their hands first. This will help protect them from infections while their immune system is still developing.

# Infant Safety:
    - Bathe baby in a specially designed, slip-resistant infant bathtub. Fill tub with 2-3 inches of warm—not hot—water (check temperature with your wrist or tub thermometer. The water should be between 96-100 degrees Fahrenheit). Stay within arm's reach of your baby while he or she is in the tub
    - Keep items such as coins, buttons, balloons, safety pins, barrettes, and rocks out of your child's reach
    - Never leave baby unattended on beds, sofas, chairs, or any place where he or she may fall.
    - Install baby gates at the top and bottom of stairways. Install a pool fence if home has a swimming pool.
    - Anchors to prevent furniture, TVs and ranges from tipping over and crushing children
    - Practice proper gun safety-keep guns out of reach
    - Store medicine and cleaning supplies out or reach

# Infant Safety:
    - Diapering – Check your newborn's diaper often, and change it when it is wet or dirty. This will help prevent diaper rash. When you change your baby:
    - Wash your hands before and after.
    - Always lay them on a flat, stable surface.
    - Never leave the baby alone.
    - Use baby wipes or a wet cloth to gently clean their skin.
    - Use diaper cream or ointment if their skin is irritated.
    - Make sure that the diaper is the right size and is not too tight.
    - If your newborn was circumcised, follow all instructions on how to care for the area as it heals.

# Infant Feeding:

Feeding – Feed your newborn when they show signs of being hungry. Signs include waking up from sleep, moving their head around, or sucking on their hands, lips, or tongue. Most newborns need to eat about 8 to 12 times a day. Burp your newborn gently after each feed.
    For all infants, experts recommend that caregivers introduce traditional supplemental foods (eg, cereals; puréed fruits, vegetables, and meats) beginning between four and six months 

    If your infant has no signs of allergy with the initial foods, additional foods can be introduced gradually, including the highly allergenic foods (eg, cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, and shellfish) 

    Whole cow's milk should not be given to any child until after age 12 months, but yogurt and cheese can be given before 12 months. 

    Whole nuts should not be given to infants because of the choking risk, but caregivers can spread a thin layer of nut butter on other foods, or purée nuts or nut butters with fruits or vegetables.

    Hard/Round foods that could cause choking (eg, nuts, grapes, raw carrots, or candies)

    honey is not recommended due to the potential risk of exposure to a harmful bacteria toxin (botulism poisoning). 

    Star anise causes neurotoxicity in infants and should be avoided

    spinach, beets, green beans, squash, and carrots should not be given to infants younger than four months of age because they may contain enough of a chemical (nitrates) to cause a condition that reduces the amount of oxygen carried by the blood (methemoglobinemia).

    Fruit juice should be introduced when an infant is older than 12 months. Before age 12 months, fruit juice is usually not necessary or recommended

# Newborn Bathing

Bathing – Newborns do not need to be bathed every day. You can give sponge baths until the umbilical cord stump falls off. This usually happens within a week or 2 after birth. For a sponge bath, keep your baby covered with a towel to stay warm. Uncover 1 part of their body at a time, and use a washcloth and warm (not hot) water to clean them.

If possible, have another caregiver help you when you bathe your newborn. Never leave a baby alone in or near water.

# Soothing and Comforting

Soothing and comforting – When your newborn cries, they might be hungry or need a diaper change. But it's also normal for babies to cry for no obvious reason. To soothe your baby, you can try:

Holding or rocking them

Putting them in a baby carrier or wrap that you wear

Swaddling them 

Making a "shushing" sound or using a white noise machine

Putting them in a car seat and going for a drive

# Look out for:

contact your physician if your infant:

Is not eating normally

Seems to be working harder than normal to breathe

Has a fever of 100.4 F or 38 C or higher. You should take your baby to a doctor or nurse if they have a rectal temperature of  100.4 F or 38 C or higher. This is important even if your baby looks normal or doesn't seem sick. never give aspirin to a baby or child younger than 18 years old. Aspirin can cause a dangerous condition called Reye syndrome.
Does not have a wet diaper for 8 hours or longer

Spits up a lot

Has blood in their diaper

Has any changes in the color of their skin

Cries for longer than 2 hours without stopping

Has redness or oozing around the umbilical cord stump

You should also call for help if you are struggling to take care of or feed your baby.

# Breastfeeding education:

- Mothers should consume a healthy, well-balanced diet that includes dairy, meat and fish, and other vitamin- and mineral-rich foods. To ensure that you get all the vitamin and minerals you need, it is a good idea to take a multivitamin-mineral supplement while breastfeeding (prenatal vitamin-mineral supplement). 
- The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all breastfed babies receive a daily supplement of vitamin D of 400 international units (10 micrograms) per day, beginning soon after birth. This is because breast milk is low in vitamin D, even if you are getting the recommended amount of vitamin D (600 international units or 15 micrograms daily) through your diet or supplements.
- take a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement or prenatal supplement every day containing 150 mcg of iodine in the form of potassium iodide, as recommended by the American Thyroid Association and the AAP.

# Risk Factors

    - The primary risk factors for iodine deficiency are a diet without iodized salt or dairy products. Dietary iodine deficiency may also be worsened by smoking, iron deficiency, and frequent consumption of foods that interfere with the production of thyroid hormones, including brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli. If your diet is very low in iodine, this might cause your baby to have problems with growth, brain development, and thyroid function)
    - You should choose fish that are low in mercury, such as cod, haddock, salmon, or canned light tuna. You should avoid fish with high levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish
    - Many medications are safe to take while you are lactating. However, there are exceptions. For this reason, it is best to consult with your health care provider, lactation consultant, or pharmacist if you have any questions about whether a particular medicine, herb, supplement, or other product is safe for your baby while you are breastfeeding
    - Over-the-counter decongestants that contain pseudoephedrine (sample brand name: Sudafed) can also decrease milk supply.

# Slide 21

- Illegal drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), and heroin are not safe for you or your baby; people who use these drugs are advised to not breastfeed.
- Cannabis while cannabis (marijuana) is legal in some places, there are limited data on its effects in babies; for this reason, experts advise people who are breastfeeding to avoid all cannabis products (including smoking, vaping, or in edibles).
- Alcohol When you consume alcohol, a small percentage of alcohol is transferred into your breast milk; however, when the alcohol is cleared from the bloodstream, it is also cleared from the milk. The amount of alcohol considered to be "safe" while breastfeeding is controversial. A number of factors affect how much alcohol is transferred to breast milk and how much the baby absorbs.
- Tobacco Babies of parents who smoke have an increased risk of a number of conditions, including asthma, pneumonia, ear infections, bronchitis, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), among others. Smoking can also reduce your milk supply. These health risks are caused by the mother's smoking during pregnancy and also by exposing the baby to secondhand smoke after birth
- If you use e-cigarettes (vape), be aware that most vaping devices and liquids contain nicotine (the addictive drug found in tobacco products). Even though e-cigarettes don't generate tobacco smoke, this does not mean they are harmless. Nicotine enters the breast milk. The exact effects of this nicotine exposure on a baby are not known, but some studies have shown that nicotine in breast milk can disturb a baby's sleep and cause changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Vaping nicotine might also decrease your milk production.
